AccessTooltip
=============

An accessible title to tooltip script, activable on focus event.

see in action on [access42.net](http://access42.net)

## Instruction

Simply link the JS file or copy/paste the function's code in your own JS script then listener event's in your onload event function.

If you link the JS file you may want to avoid function name conflict with another JS code by using a self-executing anonymous function with this pattern :

    (function(){
        code here...
    }();
